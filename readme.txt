WEEK 6

Please note the following assumptions I made for this assignment based on the instructions 
(The assignment instructions were a little unclear in my opinion and, to my knowledge, there is no example to reference on Blackboard):
- 1 image should be visible on the screen at any given time
- the user can cycle through a total of 4 different images when their mouse rests over the image that is currently showing

How Sam Farley Went Above and Beyond:
- Added 3 different image sections instead of just one and used a total of 15 images
- Added headings for each image section
- Hosted this assignment on github (https://farleysm8909.github.io/CS601_HW6_Farley/)
- Used flexbox for layout
- Used 2 google fonts, wanted to make the images look reminiscent of a scrapbook
- Added image captions for each image that change based on which image is showing (using v-if and a "current" variable)
